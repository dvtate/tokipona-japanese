# tokipona-japanese
- A program to compress/decompress toki pona written with the latin alphabet and toki pona using japanese Kanji and Hirigana
- I got these words from http://tokipona.net/tp/classicwordlist.aspx
- My mother destroied my original copy when she decided to throw my computer out of a 2nd story window
- This was a 2-day (both were school days) project, and very clearly is designed for ease of programming as opposed to performance and functionality.
- I would like to thank toki-pona for only having 120 words, making my life much easier
